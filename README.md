This is the coding playground for the program to be uploaded to the Intel Galileo board.

* Anaiss: An iPhone Passcode Brute-force Cracking Device
    * To-do list:
        * Get the iPhone hash/encryption file
        * Formulate algorithm for getting all permutations from 0000 to 9999
        * Input all permutations to the target iPhone device

* DigiLog: A Digital Logic Design Calculator
    
    To-do list:
        * Study the schematic of a calculator
        * Validate given input is in correct format, i.e. in correct mathematical form
        * Isolate each operands and operators
        * Run through the operands per character for the positional notation conversion (to convert the given operands to base 10)
        * Convert the result to the target base by division operation
    
    12.25.2015 Update:
