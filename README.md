This is the coding playground for the program to be uploaded to the Intel Galileo board.

* Anaiss: An iPhone Passcode Brute-force Cracking Device

To-do list:
* Get the iPhone hash/encryption file
* Formulate algorithm for getting all permutations from 0000 to 9999
* Input all permutations to the target iPhone device

* DigiLog: A Digital Logic Design Calculator

To-do list:
* Study the schematic of a calculator
* Validate given input is in correct format, i.e. in correct mathematical form
* Isolate each operands and operators
* Run through the operands per character for the positional notation conversion (to convert the given operands to base 10)
* Convert the result to the target base by division operation
